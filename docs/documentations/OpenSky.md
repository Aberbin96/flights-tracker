# OpenSky REST API[¶](#opensky-rest-api "Link to this heading")

The root URL of our REST API is:

https://opensky\-network.org/api

There are several functions available to retrieve [state vectors](index.html#state-vectors), flights and tracks for the whole network, a particular sensor, or a particular aircraft. Note that the functions to retrieve state vectors of sensors other than your own are rate limited (see [Limitations](#limitations)).

## All State Vectors[¶](#all-state-vectors "Link to this heading")

The following API call can be used to retrieve any state vector of the OpenSky. Please note that rate limits apply for this call (see [Limitations](#limitations)). For API calls without rate limitation, see [Own State Vectors](#own-states).

### Operation[¶](#operation "Link to this heading")

`GET /states/all`

### Request[¶](#request "Link to this heading")

You can (optionally) request state vectors for particular airplanes or times using the following request parameters:

| Property | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| time     | integer | The time in seconds since epoch (Unix time stamp to retrieve states for. Current time will be used if omitted.                                                                                                       |
| icao24   | string  | One or more ICAO24 transponder addresses represented by a hex string (e.g. abc9f3). To filter multiple ICAO24 append the property once for each address. If omitted, the state vectors of all aircraft are returned. |

In addition to that, it is possible to query a certain area defined by a bounding box of WGS84 coordinates. For this purpose, add all of the following parameters:

| Property | Type  | Description                                      |
| -------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| lamin    | float | lower bound for the latitude in decimal degrees  |
| lomin    | float | lower bound for the longitude in decimal degrees |
| lamax    | float | upper bound for the latitude in decimal degrees  |
| lomax    | float | upper bound for the longitude in decimal degrees |

Lastly, you can request the category of aircraft by adding the following request parameter:

| Property | Type    | Description          |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| extended | integer | Set to 1 if required |

Example query with time and aircraft: `https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all?time=1458564121&icao24=3c6444`

Example query with bounding box covering Switzerland: `https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all?lamin=45.8389&lomin=5.9962&lamax=47.8229&lomax=10.5226`

### Limitations[¶](#limitations "Link to this heading")

#### Limitiations for anonymous (unauthenticated) users[¶](#limitiations-for-anonymous-unauthenticated-users "Link to this heading")

Anonymous are those users who access the API without using credentials. The limitations for anonymous users are:

- Anonymous users can only get the most recent state vectors, i.e. the time parameter will be ignored.
- Anonymous users can only retrieve data with a time resolution of 10 seconds. That means, the API will return state vectors for time 𝑛⁢𝑜⁢𝑤 −(𝑛⁢𝑜⁢𝑤 𝑚⁢𝑜⁢𝑑 10).
- Anonymous users get 400 API credits per day (see credit usage below).

#### Limitations for OpenSky users[¶](#limitations-for-opensky-users "Link to this heading")

Note

IMPORTANT: Legacy accounts can continue using the API as before; however, basic authentication using your username and password is being deprecated and will only be supported for a limited time. Accounts created on the new website since mid-March 2025 do not have additional privileges and will receive an Unauthorized response. If you have a new account, follow the instructions in the section below on using the OAuth2 client credentials flow.

An OpenSky user is anybody who uses a valid OpenSky account or corresponding API client to access the API. The rate limitations for OpenSky users are:

- OpenSky users clients can retrieve data of up to 1 hour in the past. If the time parameter has a value 𝑡 <𝑛⁢𝑜⁢𝑤 −3600 the API will return 400 Bad Request.
- OpenSky users can retrieve data with a time resolution of 5 seconds. That means, if the _time_ parameter was set to 𝑡, the API will return state vectors for time 𝑡 −(𝑡 𝑚⁢𝑜⁢𝑑 5).
- OpenSky users get 4000 API credits per day. This is also true for the default privileges when using the API client. For higher request loads please contact OpenSky.
- Active contributing OpenSky users get a total of 8000 API credits per day. An active user is a user which has an ADS-B receiver that is at least 30% online (measured over the current month).

Note

If you are feeding and using the API client it will take 50+ requests before your credit allowance is increased to 8000. This new credit allowance is dynamic and not tied to any role so you will still see the default role with 4000 credits in the API client info. To verirfy you are getting 8000 credits inspect the x-rate-limit-remaining response header. If at times (like the start of the day) it is greater than 4000 then you will be getting the 8000 credit allowance. This is exactly the same as how things work with basic authentication.

Note

You can retrieve all state vectors received by your receivers without any restrictions. See [Own State Vectors](#own-states). Before the request limit is reached the header X-Rate-Limit-Remaining indicates the amount of remaining credits. After the rate limit is reached the status code 429 - Too Many Requests is returned and the header X-Rate-Limit-Retry-After-Seconds indicates how many seconds until credits/request become available again.

This is currently not working for the API client and is in the process of being fixed.

#### OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow[¶](#oauth2-client-credentials-flow "Link to this heading")

To authenticate using a modern and secure method, OpenSky now supports the OAuth2 _client credentials_ flow. This is required for all accounts created since mid-March 2025 and is recommended for all programmatic access to the API.

To get started:

1.  Log in to your OpenSky account and visit the [Account](https://opensky-network.org/my-opensky/account) page.
2.  Create a new API client and retrieve your `client_id` and `client_secret`.
3.  Use these credentials to obtain an access token from the OpenSky authentication server.

Here is an example using `curl` to obtain an access token:

export CLIENT_ID\=your_client_id
export CLIENT_SECRET\=your_client_secret

export TOKEN\=$(curl \-X POST "https://auth.opensky-network.org/auth/realms/opensky-network/protocol/openid-connect/token" \\
  \-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \\
  \-d "grant\_type=client\_credentials" \\
  \-d "client\_id=$CLIENT_ID" \\
\-d "client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET" | jq \-r .access_token)

Once you have an access token, include it in the `Authorization` header of your API requests:

curl \-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://opensky-network.org/api/states/all | jq .

Note

IMPORTANT: When using the API client replace -u “USERNAME:PASSWORD” with -H “Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN in all following example requests.

The token will expire after 30 minutes. You can repeat the above request to obtain a new token as needed. If a request returns a `401 Unauthorized` response, it likely means the token has expired or is invalid.

`/states/all` and other authenticated endpoints require this token-based authentication for non-legacy accounts using your API client.

#### API credit usage[¶](#api-credit-usage "Link to this heading")

API credits are now used for all endpoints except /states/own. Credit usage is lower in general for restricted/smaller areas (/states/all) and shorter time frames (/flights and /tracks). For /states/all the credit calculation is done by square degrees. The area can be restricted by using the _lamin, lamax, lomin, lomax_ query parameters. The _area square deg_ column in the table below indicates the square degree limit - e.g. a box extending over latitude 10 degress and longitude 5 degrees, would equal 50 square degrees:

| Area square deg                | Credits | Example                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 - 25 (<500x500km)            | 1       | /api/states/all?lamin=49.7&lamax=50.5&lomin=3.2&lomax=4.6   |
| 25 - 100 (<1000x1000km)        | 2       | /api/states/all?lamin=46.5&lamax=49.9&lomin=-1.4&lomax=6.8  |
| 100 - 400 (<2000x2000km)       | 3       | /api/states/all?lamin=42.2&lamax=49.8&lomin=-4.7&lomax=10.9 |
| over 400 or all (>2000x2000km) | 4       | /api/states/all                                             |

For /flights and /tracks the credit usage is calculated by partitions used by the query, which corresponds roughly to number of days queried.

## Track by Aircraft[¶](#track-by-aircraft "Link to this heading")

Note

The tracks endpoint is purely **experimental**. You can use the flights endpoint for historical data: [Flights in Time Interval](#flights-all).

Retrieve the trajectory for a certain aircraft at a given time. The trajectory is a list of waypoints containing position, barometric altitude, true track and an on-ground flag.

In contrast to state vectors, trajectories do not contain all information we have about the flight, but rather show the aircraft’s general movement pattern. For this reason, waypoints are selected among available state vectors given the following set of rules:

- The first point is set immediately after the the aircraft’s expected departure, or after the network received the first poisition when the aircraft entered its reception range.
- The last point is set right before the aircraft’s expected arrival, or the aircraft left the networks reception range.
- There is a waypoint at least every 15 minutes when the aircraft is in-flight.
- A waypoint is added if the aircraft changes its track more than 2.5°.
- A waypoint is added if the aircraft changes altitude by more than 100m (~330ft).
- A waypoint is added if the on-ground state changes.

Tracks are strongly related to [flights](#flights-all). Internally, we compute flights and tracks within the same processing step. As such, it may be benificial to retrieve a list of flights with the API methods from above, and use these results with the given time stamps to retrieve detailed track information.
